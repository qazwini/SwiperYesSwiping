Add a floating left/right page action in Swift.

### Requirements

- iOS 11.0+

### Integration

**Manually**

This only uses one file, so you can either

2. Or copy paste the code in `Sources/SwiperYesSwiping` into a swift file in your project.

**Swift Package Manager**

You can also integrate it into your project using Swift Package Manager.
In Xcode, go to `File -> Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency` and paste in the repo's url: `https://github.com/qazwini/SwiperYesSwiping`
